## Email Functionality

Since to send mails we need OAuth password and a host mail address, so you can add your creds in `creds.py` file in root directory.
Also since I have not build the user login/signin functionality, you need to give your email address for recieving mail. (make sure it is different from the host mail)

This is how a mail will look like:
